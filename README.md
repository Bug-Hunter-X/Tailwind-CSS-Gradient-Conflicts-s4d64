# Tailwind CSS Gradient Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a potential issue when using Tailwind CSS gradients and other conflicting styles within the same element.

The issue arises when attempting to apply a gradient using `bg-gradient-to-*` and including other background styles that could override or interfere with the gradient's rendering. This can lead to unexpected visual results.

The `bug.js` file contains an example of such a conflict, and the `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a solution to avoid this problem.

## Solutions

* **Specificity:** Ensure that the gradient classes have higher specificity than any conflicting classes. You can achieve this by using more specific selectors or by adding `!important` (use cautiously).
* **Separate Elements:** For complex layouts, consider separating the gradient background into its own element, allowing for better control over styling.
* **Careful Class Ordering:** Pay close attention to the order of your Tailwind classes.  Classes declared later in the chain can override earlier ones. 

This repository aims to highlight a subtle yet important point in using Tailwind CSS gradients effectively.  By understanding potential conflicts and utilizing appropriate solutions, you can avoid unexpected styling behaviors and ensure your UI renders correctly.
