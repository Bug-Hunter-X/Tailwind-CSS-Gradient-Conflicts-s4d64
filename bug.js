```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 ...">
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient functionality, but it may cause unexpected behavior if the `...` contains conflicting classes or properties that interfere with the gradient's rendering.  For example, using `bg-red-500` within the same element would override the gradient.
